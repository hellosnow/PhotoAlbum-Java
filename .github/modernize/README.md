- High-level system architecture
- Technology stack overview
- Data flow diagrams (photo upload and display processes)
- Application layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access)
- Component dependencies
- Deployment architecture (Docker Compose setup)
- Assessment summary with Azure migration opportunities

**Key Diagrams**:
1. System Architecture - Overall application structure
2. Technology Stack - All frameworks and libraries
3. Photo Upload Flow - Sequence diagram showing upload process
4. Photo Display Flow - Sequence diagram showing retrieval process
5. Application Layers - Layered architecture view
6. Component Dependencies - Dependency graph
7. Deployment Architecture - Container setup

## Current Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java 8
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 2.7.18
- **Database**: Oracle Database 21c Express Edition
- **ORM**: Hibernate/JPA
- **Template Engine**: Thymeleaf
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3.0, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose

## Key Findings

### Strengths
✅ Clean layered architecture with good separation of concerns  
✅ RESTful API design for photo operations  
✅ Comprehensive validation for file uploads  
✅ Containerized deployment ready  
✅ Well-structured Spring Boot application  

### Areas for Improvement
⚠️ Java 8 is end-of-life; upgrade to Java 11, 17, or 21 recommended  
⚠️ Spring Boot 2.7.x approaching end-of-support; migrate to Spring Boot 3.x  
⚠️ Oracle Database dependency requires Azure-specific considerations  
⚠️ BLOB storage in database may need review for high-volume scenarios  
⚠️ No distributed caching or CDN for photo delivery  

## Azure Migration Recommendations

### Compute Options
- **Azure App Service** - Managed PaaS for web applications
- **Azure Container Apps** - Serverless containers with auto-scaling
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** - Full container orchestration

### Database Options
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** - Managed PostgreSQL service
- **Azure SQL Database** - Managed SQL Server service
- **Oracle Database on Azure** - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure on Azure

### Storage Optimization
- **Azure Blob Storage** - Replace database BLOBs with cloud object storage
- **Azure CDN** - Content delivery network for optimized photo serving
- **Azure Cache for Redis** - Caching layer for frequently accessed photos

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Azure Application Insights** - APM and monitoring
- **Azure Monitor** - Centralized logging and metrics
- **Azure Log Analytics** - Query and analyze application logs

## Next Steps

1. **Review Assessment Report**: Open `report.json` to see detailed issue analysis
2. **Review Architecture Diagrams**: Open `assessment-diagram.md` to understand current architecture
