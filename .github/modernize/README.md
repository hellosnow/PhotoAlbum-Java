**Severity Breakdown**:
- Mandatory: 13 incidents (must fix for Azure migration)
- Potential: 13 incidents (recommended improvements)

**Target Azure Services**:
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure App Service
- Azure Container Apps

### 2. Architecture Diagram (`assessment-diagram.md`)
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of current application architecture
- **Content**: 
  - Current architecture layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access)
  - Technology stack diagram
  - Data flow sequence diagrams
  - Key components and configuration
  - Migration considerations for Azure

**Architecture Highlights**:
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 2.7.18
- **Java Version**: 1.8
- **Database**: Oracle Database (FREEPDB1)
- **Template Engine**: Thymeleaf
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Storage**: Local file system for photos

## Application Overview

**PhotoAlbum-Java** is a web-based photo gallery application that allows users to:
- Upload photos (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- View photo galleries
- Manage photo metadata

The application follows a traditional three-tier architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Spring MVC controllers + Thymeleaf templates
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Spring services with validation
3. **Data Access Layer**: Spring Data JPA repositories

## Next Steps for Azure Migration

Based on the assessment findings, recommended migration priorities:

1. **Infrastructure Changes**:
   - [ ] Migrate Oracle Database to Azure SQL or PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Move file storage to Azure Blob Storage
   - [ ] Externalize configuration to Azure Key Vault

2. **Application Modernization**:
   - [ ] Upgrade Java from 8 to 17 or 21 (LTS)
   - [ ] Upgrade Spring Boot from 2.7.18 to 3.x
   - [ ] Remove hardcoded credentials from configuration files
   - [ ] Implement Azure-native authentication

3. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - [ ] Containerize application with Docker
   - [ ] Choose target Azure service (App Service, Container Apps, or AKS)
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for Azure deployment
   - [ ] Configure Azure Application Insights for monitoring
